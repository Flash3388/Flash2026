# frc-robot-template

Template for FRC robot projects.

## Run Configuration

The project has several pre-made run configurations for your convenience. These configurations will be loaded automatically when you open the project.

To use a run configuration, select it from the configurations drop down box and click on _run_.

### For Real RObot

Select the `Robot Deploy` run configuration and click on run. This will build and deploy the code to the robot.

Select the `Robot Deploy Debug` run configuration to deploy the code with debugger enabled.

To attach a debugger, after a successful deployment (i.e. wait for the deployment to finish successfully), select and run the `RoboRIO Debugger` (run with debug, the bug button, not the run button).

### For Simulation

Select the `Simulate` run configuration and click on run. This will build and run the code in the simulator.

You can also run with _debugger_ by cliking on the _bug_ button instead of the _run_ button.
